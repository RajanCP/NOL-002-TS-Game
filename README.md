# SpeedTyper

SpeedTyper is a fast-paced typing game that helps you improve both speed and accuracy by racing against a timer to correctly type random sentences. Based on [Typeracer](<https://play.typeracer.com/>).

## How it Works

Type in sentences as you race against the clock, view your accuracy % change dynamically as you progress.  
The time starts on your first keystroke and ends once it reaches zero (or when you win!).

Up the difficulty to challenge yourself (Easy, Medium & Hard)

Try to type the sentences accurately and swiftly before the time runs out!
