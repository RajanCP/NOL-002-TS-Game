bugs multiply fast, and logic quickly spirals into chaos if left unchecked.","Debugging isn't just technical - it requires hypothesis, analysis, and intuition to trace unpredictable runtime errors across deeply nested components and asynchronous chains.","Recursive logic, though elegant in structure, can create stack overflows or infinite loops without careful control (especially with unchecked base cases).","Optimizing large applications means balancing memory use, compute time, and user experience - sometimes painfully so, as trade-offs often introduce edge cases and regressions.","Good architecture separates concerns; that principle alone saves thousands of hours across scaling teams, allowing modular development, testing, and long-term code health.","Security matters deeply: sanitize inputs, hash passwords, and validate sessions or, as we say, 'patch now or pay later.'","Multithreading offers performance gains, yet introduces race conditions, deadlocks, and obscure concurrency bugs that are hard to reproduce (and even harder to prevent).","Writing clear documentation is as valuable as writing code; as one engineer said, 'Write for the next person who reads your code - it might be you.'","Semantic versioning signals intent: breaking changes demand major updates; as a rule, 'if you break it, bump it.'","Tests reduce fear;
