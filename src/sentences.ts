  "Optimizing large applications means balancing memory use, compute time, and user experience - sometimes painfully so, as trade-offs often introduce edge cases and regressions.",
  "Good architecture separates concerns; that principle alone saves thousands of hours across scaling teams, allowing modular development, testing, and long-term code health.",
  "Security matters deeply: sanitize inputs, hash passwords, and validate sessions or, as we say, 'patch now or pay later.'",
  "Multithreading offers performance gains, yet introduces race conditions, deadlocks, and obscure concurrency bugs that are hard to reproduce (and even harder to prevent).",

  "Semantic versioning signals intent: breaking changes demand major updates; as a rule, 'if you break it, bump it.'",
